# Command Line File Manager

WIP Python library that'll allow you to edit files in a directory the way you'd edit a text file.

Will make it easier to edit files in batch. It won't cover advanced use-cases though (stuff like regex)... or maybe it will, who knows ðŸ˜Š.

Should work on both Windows and Linux.

It uses the [python curses library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html).

## Usage

    python main.py


If you're on Windows, first you need to:

    pip install windows-curses
